### Adaptive Sports Toolkit

Jointly developed by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Sport Singapore (SportSG), the Adaptive Sports Toolkit contains a selection of adaptive sports suitable for Community Care seniors who are wheelchair users.  

The toolkit provides facilitation tips and step-by-step instructions to set-up and play adaptive sports, with additional assistance offered through instructional videos.  Together, these resources allow for staff and volunteers to facilitate adaptive sports sessions (for individuals and teams) confidently.
