### Adaptive Sports Toolkit

Jointly developed by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Sport Singapore (SportSG), the Adaptive Sports Toolkit is intended as a resource for Community Care staff and volunteers. It features a selection of adaptive sports that have been piloted in the Community Care sector. These sports are suitable for players using wheelchairs.

The toolkit provides facilitation tips and step-by-step instructions to set-up and play adaptive sports, with additional assistance offered through instructional videos.  Together, these resources allow for staff and volunteers to facilitate adaptive sports sessions (for individuals and teams) confidently.
