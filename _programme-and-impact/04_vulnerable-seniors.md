### Connecting Vulnerable Seniors Through Sport 

SportCares, in partnership with [Active Health](https://www.activehealth.sg) and [Active Masters](https://www.myactivesg.com/Programmes/For-Masters-and-Seniors), continue to proliferate adaptive sport programmes to isolated seniors. 

Reaching out to nursing homes as well as rental blocks in the community, SportCares speaheads efforts like developing a toolkit and instruction videos for ease of adoption and plug-and-play; as well as facilitating silver sports days and inter-home sport competitions.
