### SportCares' methodology uses sport and active coaching to engage young people to build self-esteem, nurture confidence and enable a strong sense of autonomy through personal development.

Across our programmes, sport operates as a 'hook' to engage young people, to encourage health and wellbeing, and to meet positive youth development outomes through transferable skill development.   Friendships and relationships built through sport also remove young people from negative influences including anti-social peer groups, dependence & addiction, low self-esteem and boredom.

__Transferable skills learnt through sport include:__

* Commitment & Accountability
* Communication skills
* Problem solving
* Team work
* Dealing with stress, and;
* Goal setting and Future Planning

__Participation in sport has additional benefits for youth development including:__

* Overall improvements in health and mental health
* Self-confidence
* Increased sense of social inclusion and community participation, and;
* Self-discipline


SportCares works closely with social service organisations, grassroots groups and government agencies to actively reach out to children and youth in the community and engaging them in development, preventive or intervention sport programmes.
