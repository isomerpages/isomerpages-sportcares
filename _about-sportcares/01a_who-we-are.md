SportCares started in 2012 as the first recommendation launched under Sport Singapore's Vision 2030 Live Better Through Sport Master Plan.  

The mission was to use sport as a force for social good - enabling the vulnerable and persons with disabilities to experience and reap the benefits of sport by harnessing the power of sport to unite people from different communities and beliefs, instil confidence, and elevate one's outlook on life.

SportCares was to also seed a movement that cultivates a spirit of sport philanthropy within the community.  To catalyse these efforts, Sport Singapore provides dollar-for-dollar matching for donations to SportCares.
