#### SportCares utilises the power of community based sporting experiences to harness the life aspirations of vulnerable children, youth at-risk, socially isolated seniors and persons with disabilities & special needs.

By using sport as an engagement strategy to bring about positive change in their lives, we are able to address social issues in the community. 

In addition to designing and delivering sport-centric programmes for the community segments we serve, we also advise organisations on benefits of harnessing the power of sport as a means of social change.

At present, we have impacted the lives of more than 36,000 constituents across Singapore.

Working alongside like-minded partners from government agencies, corporates, social service agencies and non-profit organisations allow us to take a community development approach to bring about long-term change to the lives of the vulnerable and the disabled in Singapore.
